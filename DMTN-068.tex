\setDocAbstract{
We report on the investigation into the use of lossy compression algorithms on LSST
images that otherwise could not be stored for general retrieval and use by scientists.
We find that modest quantization of images coupled with lossless compression algorithms
can provide a factor of $\sim$6 savings in storage space while still providing images
useful for followup scientific investigations.  Given that this is only means 
that some products could be made quickly available to users and would free 
resources for community ues that would otherwise be necessary to re-compute these 
products, we recommend that LSST consider using a lossy compression to archive and 
serve image products where appropriate.
